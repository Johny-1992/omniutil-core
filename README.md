# OmniUtil Core

OmniUtil is a universal utility protocol designed to capture real-world usage
and redistribute value across a global interoperable ecosystem.

This repository contains:
- Protocol logic (MERIT, ledger, royalties)
- Wallet core
- Partner-ready APIs
- Simulation engines

OmniUtil is infrastructure. Not a token. Not an app.
